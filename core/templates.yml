# This file is one of the central points in the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit configuration and
# a counterpart to the folder configuration structure.
#
# The folder structure underneath the project folder is used to create folders on disk -
# templates.yml (this file) refers to those folders. Therefore, the two files need to be
# in sync. This file contains an overview of all locations that are used by Sgtk.
#
# Whenever an app or an engine refers to a location on disk, it is using an entry defined in
# this file. For more information, see the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit Documentation.

# The keys section contains the definitions for all the different keys that are being
# used by Sgtk. A key is a magic token that is replaced by a value at runtime, for example
# {Shot}. The section below tells Sgtk which data types and formats to expect for each key.

# The paths section contains all the the key locations where files are to be stored
# by Sgtk Apps. Each path is made up of several keys (like {version} or {shot}) and
# these are defined in the keys section above.
#
# Apps use these paths as part of their configuration to define where on disk
# different files should go.
#

paths:

    # Common  path definitions to use as shorthand in order to avoid repetitive and verbose
    # templates. This also makes it easy to change any of the common root paths and have the
    # changes apply to all templates that use them.
    #
    # These don't require the standard formatting (with definition and root_name) because they
    # will be set within each template that uses the alias.
